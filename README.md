## Versioning System for Online Book Updates
To maintain clarity and transparency in the evolution of this online book, we use a structured versioning system that distinguishes between significant updates and smaller changes. The versioning format follows a **Major.Minor** structure:

### **Major Versions (X.0)**:
A major version update indicates significant changes to the book, typically involving updates, additions, or restructuring of entire chapters. These updates may reflect new content, substantial revisions, or major reorganization to enhance the book's structure or scope.

### **Minor Versions (X.Y)**:
A minor version update denotes changes to specific sections within a chapter. These changes might include:
- Expanding a section with new material
- Rewriting sections for improved clarity
- Adding new subsections or examples to an existing chapter

### **Excluded Changes**:
Typos, grammatical corrections, formatting adjustments, or other minor editorial edits that do not materially affect the book's content or structure are not reflected in the versioning system.

### **Version Numbering Example**:
- **1.0**: Initial release or major update to chapters
- **1.1**: Update to a section in Chapter 1
- **2.0**: Addition of a new chapter or major overhaul of an existing chapter

By adhering to this system, readers can easily track and identify substantive updates to the bookâ€™s content while avoiding confusion caused by minor, inconsequential changes.
