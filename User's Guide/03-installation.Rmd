# Installing RMC-TotalRisk {#installation}

RMC-TotalRisk version 1.0 is available as a portable package (.zip). Installing a portable package does not require administrative rights. Simply extract all contents of the portable package to the desired computer location. Figure \@ref(fig:figure-1) shows an example of the package contents after extraction. Double-click the executable **RMC-TotalRisk.exe** to get started. For easy access to the program, create a desktop shortcut and pin the program to the Windows task bar. 

```{r figure-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RMC-TotalRisk executable file in the RMC-TotalRisk portable .zip directory.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/figure1.png")
```

## Setting the File Association in Windows

RMC-TotalRisk files have a “.tra” file extension. To have Windows automatically open .tra files with RMC-TotalRisk, right-click a .tra project file. Select **Open with…** from the resulting menu (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-2)). 

```{r figure-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Right-click to select how to open a file in Windows.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/figure2.png")
```

From the menu that appears when you select **Open with…**, click **Try an app on this PC** for an expanded list of already installed applications. If RMC-TotalRisk is not an option, scroll to the bottom and select **Look for another app on this PC**. This opens a Windows Explorer dialog. Navigate to and select the executable **RMC-TotalRisk.exe**, then click **Open**. 

When you’ve found RMC-TotalRisk and selected it, check the box labeled **Always use this app to open [.tra] files** before you click the **OK** button. Now .tra files appear in Windows Explorer with the RMC TotalRisk icon (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3)). You can now double-click a project file to automatically open it with RMC-TotalRisk.

```{r figure-3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RMC-TotalRisk project with file association in Windows.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/figure3.png")
```
