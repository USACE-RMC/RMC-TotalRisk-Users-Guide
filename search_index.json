"],["welcome.html", "1 Welcome to RMC-TotalRisk", " 1 Welcome to RMC-TotalRisk The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Risk Management Center (RMC) developed the quantitative risk analysis software (RMC-TotalRisk) to enhance and expedite risk assessments conducted by the USACE Flood Risk Management, Planning, and Dam and Levee Safety Communities of Practice. RMC-TotalRisk is a menu-driven software that conducts risk analysis based on user-defined hazard, transform, system response, and consequence functions. The software features a fully integrated modelling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry capabilities, and report quality charts and diagnostics. RMC-TotalRisk can perform multi-failure risk analysis for individual dams or levees as well as for complex system with multiple components. "],["why-you-should-use-rmc-totalrisk.html", "1.1 Why You Should Use RMC-TotalRisk", " 1.1 Why You Should Use RMC-TotalRisk RMC-TotalRisk is a powerful risk analysis software designed with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. It simplifies the complexity of risk assessments by connecting the core components of risk — hazard, transform, response, and consequences — through a clear and intuitive risk diagram. The software generates a comprehensive range of risk outputs, including excess, background, total, failure, and non-failure risks. Each component of the analysis can incorporate uncertainty, and the software supports modeling multiple locations with distinct failure modes as separate system components, streamlining system-level risk evaluations. RMC-TotalRisk offers unique capabilities that set it apart from other USACE software. It supports diverse hazard types, including floods, earthquakes, and wildfires, extending beyond the flood hazards modeled by most tools. The software also accommodates a wide range of consequence types, enabling assessments of life loss, economic impacts, and environmental effects. Seamless integration with other USACE programs allows it to import data from RMC-RFA, RMC-BestFit, RRFT, ERDC-StormSim, HEC-WAT, HEC-RAS, HEC-SSP, and LifeSim, providing unparalleled inter-software compatibility. The software includes advanced functionalities, such as event tree analysis, which enables users to model geotechnical and structural performance with diagnostic and sensitivity tools unavailable in other USACE platforms. RMC-TotalRisk uniquely accounts for multiple failure modes, offering options for joint, competing, common cause, and mutually exclusive failure modes, each with distinct consequences. Additionally, it models dependency between failure mode capacities and hazard functions using flexible options, including user-defined correlation matrices. RMC-TotalRisk calculates five critical types of risk — excess, background, total, failure, and non-failure — that are essential for informed decision-making. It provides comprehensive outputs, including loss exceedance curves, risk measures, and assurance metrics, all fully compliant with USACE policies for dam safety, levee safety, and flood risk management. Furthermore, it can replicate and update legacy risk analyses from tools like DAMRAE, LST, and HEC-FDA, enhancing its value for risk-informed investment decisions. "],["when-you-should-use-rmc-totalrisk.html", "1.2 When You Should Use RMC-TotalRisk", " 1.2 When You Should Use RMC-TotalRisk Use RMC-TotalRisk whenever you need to perform a risk analysis, particularly when the analysis involves complex systems with multiple components, uncertainties, or dependencies. While the software is frequently applied in flood risk management, its capabilities extend far beyond this domain. RMC-TotalRisk is relevant to any scenario involving hazards, responses, and consequences, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of scientific, engineering, and policy applications. The examples in this document relate to flood risk for dams and levees. However, the software is not limited to flood risk management applications. RMC-TotalRisk is designed as a general-purpose risk analysis software capable of estimating risk for various complex systems. Its flexibility and robust analytical framework make it suitable for applications such as: Seismic Risk Assessment: Evaluate risks associated with earthquakes, including structural vulnerabilities and potential consequences for infrastructure and populations. Wildfire Risk Management: Model the spread of wildfires, estimate the probability of occurrence, and assess associated economic, environmental, and human impacts. Environmental Risk Analysis: Analyze risks to ecosystems from natural or anthropogenic hazards, including climate change impacts, pollution, or habitat degradation. Industrial and Infrastructure Safety: Assess risks for critical infrastructure, such as power plants, bridges, or pipelines, accounting for failure modes and interdependencies. Custom Applications: Tackle any scenario where hazards and consequences can be defined, including risks related to human health, transportation systems, or supply chain disruptions. RMC-TotalRisk’s ability to integrate diverse hazards, model complex dependencies, and account for uncertainties makes it ideal for multidisciplinary applications. Whether you are working on a dam safety program, evaluating the environmental impacts of a natural disaster, or designing resilient infrastructure, RMC-TotalRisk provides the tools to comprehensively assess and communicate risk, supporting informed decision-making. "],["risk-analysis-framework.html", "2 Risk Analysis Framework", " 2 Risk Analysis Framework In RMC-TotalRisk, a risk analysis computes the risk associated with a collection of potential failure modes for each system component. A failure mode consists of three key inputs: a hazard, the system’s response to the hazard, and the consequences of that response. A non-failure mode, on the other hand, includes the hazard and the associated non-failure consequences. A risk analysis uses four types of functions as inputs: Hazard Function: Commonly called a frequency curve, this function describes the exceedance probabilities of various hazard levels. Examples include annual maximum peak flow frequency, peak reservoir pool stage frequency, and peak ground acceleration. Transform Function: This function converts hazard levels from one type to another. For example, a peak flow-frequency function can be transformed into a stage-frequency function using a flow-to-stage rating curve. Transform functions are optional. System Response Function: Often referred to as a fragility curve, this function defines the conditional probability of failure for various hazard levels, such as water surface elevations (WSEs). The system response function specifies the failure mode. Consequence Function: Sometimes called a damage function, this function describes the consequences of failure or non-failure for various hazard levels, such as annual maximum peak WSEs. For example, Figure 2.1 illustrates the conceptual risk analysis process for a levee with a single failure mode and a single system component. Beginning in the top left of the figure, the flood hazard is defined by an annual maximum peak flow-frequency distribution, estimated using flood-frequency analysis methods. Next, moving to the top right, peak flow is transformed to a WSE using a stage-discharge rating curve estimated using a hydraulic model. Then, moving to the bottom right, the system response function is defined by a probability of failure given the WSE, often derived from engineering analysis and expert elicitation methods. And finally, moving to the bottom left, the consequences given failure are estimated as a function of WSE. Figure 2.1: Levee risk analysis process for a single failure mode and a single system component. The risk analysis computes the expected annual consequences by integrating over these functions. For a deeper understanding of the mathematics involved in risk analysis, refer to the technical reference manual [1]. Additional USACE guidance on risk analysis for flood risk management is in [2] and [3]. This user guide demonstrates how to create a project; enter hazard, transform, response, and consequence functions; create a risk diagram, perform a risk analysis, and review results.

The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry capabilities, multi-failure risk analysis, and report-quality charts. The graphical user interface consists of a menu bar, tool bar, and four window panes (Figure 4.1): the Project Explorer, Tabbed Documents, Properties, and the Message window. You may move, dock, hide, or close the panes as desired. Figure 4.1: RMC-TotalRisk graphical user interface. "],["gui-menu-bar.html", "4.1 Menu Bar", " 4.1 Menu Bar The menu bar at the top of the window (Figure 4.2) contains important commands for working with RMC TotalRisk. The following subsections provide detail on each command. Figure 4.2: RMC-TotalRisk menu bar. 4.1.1 File The File menu (Figure 4.3) provides essential file management functionality. From this menu, you create a new project, open an existing project, save or save as, open recent projects, or exit the application. Figure 4.3: File menu. The first time you use RMC-TotalRisk, the recent projects list will be empty. If your recent projects exceed the number that the list shows at one time (the default is 10), a menu item labeled More Files… is available. That option opens a Recent Files dialog showing all available recent project files (Figure 4.4). From here, you may open any recently used project file or clear the recent project file list. Figure 4.4: Recent file dialog. 4.1.2 View You may move, dock, hide, or close the Project Explorer, the Properties window, and Message window as desired. The View menu (Figure 4.5) allows you to unhide or open these windows. In addition, you can restore the default layout of the panes. Figure 4.5: View menu. 4.1.3 Project The Project menu (Figure 4.6) contains commands related to the project you are working in. From this menu, you can create a new hazard, transform, system response, or consequence function. You can also add a new risk analysis. In addition, you can edit the project properties through the Properties window. Figure 4.6: Project menu. 4.1.4 Tools The Tools menu (Figure 4.7) provides tools for managing your project and personalizing your workspace. Figure 4.7: Tools menu. Compact &amp; Optimize Project File compacts and optimizes the project database and removes unnecessary tables. This tool can significantly reduce the size of your file without losing any project data. Zip Project File zips your project file and prompts you to save the .zip to a location on your computer. The zip file is smaller and easier to share with others. Restore From Backup restores the project from the backup file (***.tra.bak). Note: RMC-TotalRisk creates a backup file every 30 minutes by default. You can change the backup frequency in the Options dialog, File Management tab. Equivalent Annual Consequences (Figure 4.8) calculates equivalent annual consequences (EqAC) between two risk analyses. EqAC is required in USACE cost evaluation procedures [1]. The EqAC is automatically calculated when you define the analysis period (in years) and a discount rate (as a percentage), then select current and future risk analyses and the year those results represent. Use the table tools to add and remove EqAC calculations. You can also manually enter base and future plan results by clicking in the dropdowns and typing the value. Figure 4.8: Equaivalent Annual Consequences tool. Batch Run (Figure 4.9) simulates multiple risk analyses as a batch process. Batch processing is very useful when inputs have been changed that are common across multiple risk analyses. Figure 4.9: Batch Run Risk Analyses tool.

When you customize the layout, RMC-TotalRisk remembers the configuration. For example, if you change the docking location of the Project Explorer and then close RMC-TotalRisk, the next time that you open the software, the Project Explorer is docked in that same location. 4.3.1 Types of Windows RMC-TotalRisk has four basic window types: the Project Explorer, Tabbed Documents, Properties, and the Message Window (Figure 4.1). These windows provide editing and reviewing space for the various project components, including hazard, response, and consequence functions. For tool windows, resize and drag them by their title bars. For document windows, drag them by their tabs. On the title bars in the Project Explorer, Properties window, and Message Window, a dropdown offers other options (Figure 4.15). Figure 4.15: Tools window options. On the Tabbed Documents pane, you can right-click on document tabs to set other options on the window. These options include docking, floating, and hiding windows (Figure 4.16). Figure 4.16: Document window options. 4.3.2 Tab Groups When you are working with two or more open documents in RMC-TotalRisk, you can group tabbed documents to enhance your ability to manage a limited workspace. Organize multiple document and tool windows into either vertical or horizontal tab groups or move documents from one group to another by dragging and dropping them; even float and move windows and tab groups to different monitors. When you need to view or edit two documents at once, you can split windows by creating two horizontal tab groups, as shown in Figure 4.17. Figure 4.17: Split document windows. 4.3.3 Move and Dock Windows You can dock a document window in the Tabbed Documents area or float it as a separate window independent of the main window. You can arrange windows in the following ways: Dock tool windows to the edge of the main window frame. Float tool and document windows over or outside the main window. Hide tool windows along the edge of the main window. Display windows on different monitors. Reset window placement to the default layout by choosing View &gt; Reset Default Layout. Arrange windows by dragging or right-clicking the title bar or tab of the window being arranged. When you click and drag the title bar of a tool window or the tab of a document window, a cross-shaped window placement guide appears. During the drag operation, when the cursor is over one of the arrows in the guide, a shaded area appears that shows you where the window docks if you release the mouse button. Figure 4.18 and Figure 4.19 show examples of the window placement guide. Figure 4.18: Moving and docking document windows. Figure 22 shows the Properties window being docked below the Project Explorer. The new location is demarcated by the light blue shared area. Figure 4.19: Example of docking the Properties window below the Project Explorer. 4.3.4 Close and Auto-Hide Tool Windows You can close a tool window by clicking on the X in the upper right of the title bar. To reopen the tool window, navigate to the View menu and select the desired tool window to show. Tool windows have an auto-hide feature, which causes a window to slide out of the way when you use a different window. When a window is auto-hidden, the window name appears on the tab at the edge of the main window, as shown in Figure 4.20. To show the window again, move your mouse cursor over the tab and the window slides back into view. Figure 4.20: Auto-Hide tool window.

"],["hazard-functions.html", "6 Hazard Functions", " 6 Hazard Functions RMC-TotalRisk defines a hazard function by the exceedance probabilities of various hazard levels, such as annual maximum peak flow or WSE. Hazard functions are also commonly referred to as frequency curves. In dam and levee risk assessments, the annual maximum peak WSE (or stage) or the annual maximum peak ground acceleration are typically the primary hazard parameters for evaluating a potential failure mode [3] [4]. As such, the hazard functions commonly describe the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of these hazard levels. RMC-TotalRisk provides six options for adding a hazard function: import from RMC-BestFit, import from RMC-RFA, or creating a parametric, nonparametric, tabular, or composite function. The following subsections explain each option in detail.

In RMC-TotalRisk, a system response function defines the conditional probability of failure for various hazard levels, such as WSEs. In dam and levee safety risk analyses, analysts develop system response functions for multiple potential failure modes (PFMs). Common PFMs include seepage and piping, erosion and bank caving, and overtopping. Each PFM may result in different consequence outcomes, so analysts should keep PFMs distinct in a risk analysis. RMC-TotalRisk allows users to define system response functions using an event tree, parametric function, tabular function, bivariate tabular function, or a composite of multiple functions. The following subsections describe each input option in detail. "],["event-tree-response-function.html", "8.1 Event Tree Response Function", " 8.1 Event Tree Response Function Event tree analyses (ETAs) represent the logic of how an initiating event, like a flood or earthquake, can lead to various types of damage and failure [3]. An event tree consists of a sequence of interconnected nodes and branches [6]. Each node corresponds to an uncertain event (e.g., a crack forming in an embankment) or an uncertain state of nature (e.g., the existence of adversely oriented joint planes). Branches originating from a node represent the possible events or states of nature that could occur. Probabilities are assigned to each node to quantify the likelihood of each event or condition, conditional on the occurrence of all preceding events in the tree. For more details on event tree calculations in RMC-TotalRisk, refer to [1]. To create an event tree response function, right-click on the System Responses folder in the Project Explorer (Figure 8.1) or navigate to Project Menu &gt; System Responses and select Add Event Tree Response…. A dialog will appear, prompting you to enter the dataset name and select an event tree template to import. This example uses the Basic template to demonstrate how to build an event tree from scratch, but you can also choose from a variety of default or user-defined templates. Figure 8.1: Create new event tree response function. After creating the new event tree response function, the Tabbed Documents area automatically opens, and the Properties window displays the event tree properties (Figure 8.2). In the Properties window, you can configure the name, description, hazard type, hazard units, hazard interpolation, probability interpolation, and selected event tree node properties. The interpolation transforms define how the data is interpolated when sampling values between hazard levels. Figure 8.2: Event tree response function properties. 8.1.1 Terminology This section defines RMC-TotalRisk’s event tree terminology [1]. Node: Represents a branching point in the event tree, signifying a random event or state. Event trees include four types of nodes: Initiating Hazard Node: Always the first node in the event tree. This node defines the hazard levels and links system response probabilities to the hazard function. Enter only hazard levels for this node, not hazard exceedance probabilities. To improve the accuracy of dam and levee risk assessments, define at least five hazard levels. Start with a hazard level with a near-zero probability of failure and progress to a level exceeding the crest height. Include intermediate levels with critical features or inflection points, such as the normal pool or the spillway invert for dams. Chance Node: Represents the probability of an event occurring at each hazard level defined in the initiating hazard node. You can define probabilities as a single value for all hazard levels (single value), as unique values for each hazard level (multi-value), or by referencing another source (see “reference node”). Reference Node: Functions like a chance node but pulls probabilities from a previously defined response function or node in the event tree instead of defining them directly at the node. Remainder Node: Represents the probability remaining after accounting for all other chance and reference node probabilities at the current branching point. For example, if an event has two potential outcomes, the remainder node accounts for the probability that neither outcome occurs. The software computes the remainder probability automatically; users cannot modify it. Branch: The line connecting two nodes in the event tree. End Node: A node with no downstream branches, representing the final state in a sequence of events. This is also called a leaf node or terminal node.. Pathway: A unique sequence of events representing a potential failure progression. The probability of a pathway equals the joint probability of all nodes in the series from the initiating hazard node to the end node. This is also referred to as a path, sequence, connection, or root-to-node. Upstream Nodes: Nodes located to the left of a selected node in the tree. These nodes must occur before the selected node’s event. Upstream nodes are also called parent nodes, conditional events, or preceding nodes. Downstream Nodes: Nodes located to the right of a selected node in the tree. These nodes occur after the selected node’s event. Downstream nodes are also called child nodes, conditional events, proceeding nodes, or subsequent nodes. Node Probability: Represents the probability of the selected node event occurring, conditioned on the occurrence of all upstream nodes. Event Likelihood: Represents the probability of a node event occurring at a given hazard level. This is the joint probability of the selected node event and all its upstream nodes. 8.1.2 Navigating an Event Tree You can move the event tree around the workspace by clicking and dragging the background canvas with any mouse button. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. When you hover over a node or branch, it highlights. Left-click to select nodes or branches, and right-click to display context menu options. When you hover over a node, a toolbar appears above it, as shown in Figure 8.3. You can also access these toolbar options by right-clicking on a node. Figure 8.3: Event tree node toolbar icons. Delete Branches: Click this icon to remove all child branches from the selected node. Copy Branches: Click to copy the child branches into memory for pasting elsewhere. Paste Branches: Click to paste previously copied branches onto the current node. Add New Branch: Click to create a new branch from the selected node. When you hover over a branch, a toolbar appears above its name, as shown in Figure 8.4. These options are also available by right-clicking on the branch. To rename a branch, double-click on it or use the branch properties. Figure 8.4: Event tree branch toolbar icons. Delete Branch: Click to remove the selected branch and all its child branches from the event tree. Branch Properties: Click to edit branch properties such as name, description, and probabilities directly in the workspace. Save Template: Save the event tree as a template for future use. This option is only available on the initiating hazard branch. 8.1.3 Customizing an Event Tree The Options tab in the event tree Properties window provides tools to customize your event tree’s appearance and layout (Figure 8.5). Height: Adjusts the height of each node in pixels. Increasing the height beyond 70 pixels allows node names to span multiple lines. Width: Sets the horizontal spacing, in pixels, between nodes. Smooth: Controls the smoothness of the connector lines between nodes. Extend: If selected, extends the terminal (leaf) nodes to align with the right-most column in the event tree. Background Color: Changes the background color of the event tree workspace. Gridline Color: Sets the color of the background gridlines in the workspace. Node Fill: Specifies the fill color for the selected node. Node Stroke: Defines the outline color for the selected node. Reset: Restores all options to their default settings when clicked. Zoom Scale: Adjusts the zoom scale factor for the event tree workspace. A value of 1 represents the base zoom level. Figure 8.5: Event tree style options. 8.1.4 Building an Event Tree This example demonstrates how to build an event tree for spillway erosion. The sequence of events includes: Pool elevation results in spillway flow, grass removal from the spillway, headcut initiation, headcut advancement to the control section, control structure failure, unsuccessful intervention, and breach. Define the hazard. Select the initiating hazard node branch, Hazard, by clicking on it. Once selected, edit its properties in the Properties window under the Selected Branch Properties subsection (Figure 8.6). Alternatively, click the Branch Properties button in the event tree node toolbar to edit the branch. Rename the branch to “Pool Elevation.” Figure 8.6: Edit the node properties from either the node toolbar or Properties window. Enter hazard levels. Use the table editing tools to input the desired hazard levels. Delete the default chance node. Remove the chance node added by default by clicking the delete button in the toolbar, or by using the Sub-Branches Properties section of the initiating hazard node. Confirm the deletion when prompted by clicking Yes. Add a new node. Add the next node in the event tree using one of the following methods: Click the Add New Branch button in the node toolbar, use the right-click node context menu on the node, or navigate to the Sub-Branches Properties section in the Properties window. After adding the node, use the Node Properties Editor to rename it, add a description, and define the event’s probability for each hazard level specified in step 1 (Figure 8.7).

Continue adding nodes and defining their properties until the event tree is fully developed (Figure 8.8). Figure 8.8: Completed spillway erosion event tree. 8.1.5 Explorting Event Tree Results The Tabbed Document contains three tabs: Event Tree, Response, and Diagnostics, each offering tools to explore the event tree analysis results. The Event Tree is used to build and edit the event tree, as described in earlier sections. The Response tab displays a graphical representation of the system response function for each hazard level (Figure 8.9). This function, commonly referred to as a fragility curve, represents the probability of failure for each defined hazard level. You can export the function data as tabular data using the Export Plot Data button. Figure 8.9: System response probability function result from event tree. The Diagnostics tab provides tools for reviewing and validating the event tree calculations. The left side of the Diagnostics tab offers options for Node Filters, Model Parameters, and Plot Options (Figure 8.10). Details for each option are provided below. Figure 8.10: Event tree diagnostic viewing options. Node Filters Show Remainder Nodes: Toggles the display of remainder nodes in the results. Combine Remainder Leaves: Combines terminal remainder nodes, which often represent non-failure conditions, into a single result. Leaf Nodes Only: Displays only terminal leaf nodes (nodes without child branches). Model Parameters Monte Carlo Iterations: Specifies the number of Monte Carlo iterations used to sample the event tree for diagnostic analysis. This option is disabled if no uncertainty is present. Hazard Level: Defines the hazard level used to calculate diagnostic results. Plot Options Event Likelihood: Displays a box-and-whisker plot of the likelihood for each node occurring at the selected hazard level (Figure 8.11). Figure 8.11: Event tree diagnostics event likelihood plot option. Correlation to SRP: Shows the Pearson correlation coefficients for how node probabilities correlate with the overall SRP. Chance nodes have a positive correlation with the SRP, whereas remainder nodes have a negative correlation. The absolute size of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the association with SRP. The nodal correlations to SRP display as a ranked tornado plot (Figure 8.12). Figure 8.12: Event tree diagnostics tree node correlation to SRP plot. Sensitivity Index: Displays each node’s first-order sensitivity index, indicating its contribution to the variance in the SRP (Figure 8.13). A high sensitivity index suggests that reducing uncertainty for that node could significantly affect the overall SRP. Figure 8.13: Event tree diagnostics tree node sensitivity indices. Node SRP Scatter: Plots the sampled probabilities of a node against the overall SRP for each Monte Carlo iteration. Nodes with strong correlations to the SRP show clear trends in this scatter plot (Figure 8.14). Figure 8.14: Event tree diagnostics tree node probability to SRP scatter plot. Tabular: Displays a table of node probabilities and the overall SRP for each Monte Carlo iteration (Figure 8.15). Use the table’s column statistics feature to verify sampling distributions (Figure 8.16). Figure 8.15: Event tree diagnostics tabular output.

These functions estimate how much life loss or economic damage to expect based on a hazard level and the associated system response. Dam and levee safety risk analyses typically define consequence functions separately for each PFM because the consequences can vary depending on the failure mode being assessed. For example, an overtopping failure mode typically provides much less warning time than an earthquake-driven failure, resulting in different life loss estimates. You can define consequence functions in RMC-TotalRisk by importing them directly from a LifeSim version 2.0 model, specifying a tabular function, or creating a composite function. The following subsections describe each consequence function option in detail.

The options are Life Loss and $ Damages. Starting Hazard is the hazard level where consequences begin. This parameter provides a lower bound for the consequence function. The starting hazard level must be below the lowest value in the imported LifeSim results. Combine Zones, if checked, combines selected LifeSim results from the entire simulation area. If unchecked, you need to select specific summary zones (regions) from LifeSim results. LifeSim can geographically separate results by summary zone, allowing flexibility when creating consequence functions. Figure 9.2: LifeSim consequence function properties.

"],["risk-analyses.html", "10 Risk Analyses", " 10 Risk Analyses In RMC-TotalRisk, you can conduct a risk analysis for a system with up to 20 system components. Each component requires three fundamental inputs: a hazard function, a system response function, and a consequence function. Transform functions are optional. A risk analysis must include at least one system component. You can use multiple components to represent either different structures within the system or various hazard types affecting a single structure. Each system component can include multiple system response functions, commonly referred to as failure modes. These failure modes may lead to different consequences. For example, in a dam scenario, a seepage failure mode might progress slowly, allowing downstream populations more time to evacuate. In contrast, a seismic failure mode could cause rapid failure, providing little evacuation time. At least one failure mode is necessary to calculate excess, failure, and total risks. A system component can include only one non-failure mode. This mode does not require a response function but is essential for calculating excess, non-failure, background, and total risks. If no non-failure mode is provided, the system assumes the non-failure consequence is zero. To compute risk, a system component must include either a failure mode or a non-failure mode.

For a 90% CI, the value of interest has a 90% probability of falling within the interval. CIs are computed only after simulating risk with full uncertainty. The default CI is 90%. Realizations: Sets the number of Monte Carlo simulation realizations for simulating risk with full uncertainty. The default is 1,000 realizations, balancing reasonably accurate CIs with shorter runtimes. The maximum allowed number of realizations is 10,000 due to runtime and file size constraints.

PRNG Seed: Defines the pseudo random number generator (PRNG) seed value for the Monte Carlo simulation. Using the same seed value ensures repeatable results, while changing the seed value alters the sequence of random numbers used in the simulation. LEC Output Length: Specifies the number of points used to construct the LECs. An LEC displays risk results with consequences on the x-axis and exceedance probability on the y-axis. Using at least 200 points is recommended to enhance the accuracy of the curves.

When the risk analysis has a single system component, the Adaptive Simpson’s Rule (ASR) performs the numerical integration. Figure 10.4 shows the available options for the ASR method. Figure 10.4: Risk analysis integration options when there is single system component. Max Evaluations: Specifies the maximum number of integrand evaluations allowed during numerical integration.

Figure 10.6: Risk analysis system component options. System Component: A system component consists of three key inputs: the hazard, the system response to that hazard, and the consequences given the response and hazard. By default, the system component is identified and labeled by the selected hazard function, which can only be used once per risk analysis. A single risk analysis is limited to 20 system components due to virtual memory and runtime constraints. Several options are available to customize how the risk analysis computes each system component. Name: Users can edit the name of the selected system component. Failure Mode Method: This setting determines how the risk analysis accounts for multiple failure modes. Options include joint, competing, common cause, and mutually exclusive failures. Note: The joint and competing methods are computationally intensive and are limited to 20 failure modes. Joint (default): Use this method when multiple failure modes can occur simultaneously during the same event. This method requires selecting a joint consequence rule. Competing: Use this method when joint failures are not possible because the system component fails when the first of the competing failure modes reaches a failure state. The system response functions’ capacity automatically determines the failure mode order. Ensure that the system response functions increase monotonically. Common Cause: This method assumes a common cause initiates multiple failure modes, but joint failures are not possible. While included for backward compatibility with existing risk analysis software, use the competing method when feasible. Mutually Exclusive: Use this method when failure modes are disjoint (have no intersection) and cannot occur simultaneously. During the risk analysis, response probabilities exceeding 1 at a given hazard level are normalized. Joint Consequences: This setting applies to the joint failure mode method and determines how joint failure consequences are treated. Options include additive, average, maximum (default), and minimum. Use additive when failure modes affect different inundation areas, and the total consequences are best represented by adding consequences for each area. Use average when inundation areas are partially overlapping. Use maximum when failure modes share the same inundation area to avoid overestimating consequences. Use minimum as a sensitivity or to establish a lower bound for risk. Failure Dependency: This option sets the statistical dependency between failure modes within the selected system component. It is unavailable for the mutually exclusive method. The dependency influences the joint probability of the response functions. The options include independent (default), perfectly positive, perfectly negative, or a user-defined correlation matrix. The Correlation Matrix option becomes available when you select it as the dependency method. Clicking the button opens a table where you can enter correlation coefficients between failure modes. Profile Hazard: This option sets the hazard function used to construct risk profiles and estimate the probability of exceeding a hazard threshold. You can select the primary hazard function or any hazard-to-response transform functions. For levee accreditation analyses, use stage or water surface elevation as the profile hazard type. Hazard Threshold: This setting defines the hazard level for calculating the probability of exceeding that threshold. The default hazard threshold is 0. For levee accreditation analyses, use the top of levee height or elevation as the hazard threshold.

The available methods are additive and joint risk: Additive Risk Method (default): Assumes system components are independent, and their consequences can be summed. This method has shorter runtimes but does not generate system-level loss exceedance curves (LECs) and computes fewer system-wide risk measures. Joint Risk Method: Allows modeling dependencies between components and generates a complete set of system risk outputs, including system-level LECs and more comprehensive risk measures. However, this method typically has longer runtimes. Joint Consequences: Defines how the risk analysis handles the consequences of joint events among system components. Options include additive, average, maximum (default), and minimum. Use additive when the system components have nonoverlapping inundation areas, where summing consequences is more appropriate. Use average when inundation areas partially overlap, and averaging the consequences is appropriate. Use maximum when modeling various hazard types affecting a single structure to prevent overestimating the consequences. Use minimum as a sensitivity or to establish a lower bound for system risk. Hazard Dependency: Specifies the statistical dependency between system component hazards in the risk analysis. This option is only available for the joint risk method. The dependency influences the joint probability of the hazard functions. Options include independent (default), perfectly positive, perfectly negative, or a user-defined correlation matrix.

This diagram provides a clear way to create and connect the components of the modeled system. A risk analysis computes the risk associated with multiple potential failure modes for each system component. Each failure mode combines a hazard, the system’s response to that hazard, and the consequences of the response. Non-failure modes consist of a hazard and the non-failure consequences associated with it. Figure 10.9 illustrates a single system component for a dam safety risk analysis. The diagram includes a non-failure mode, represented by the purple line at the top, connecting the hazard function directly to the non-failure consequences without involving a system response. Many dams experience non-failure consequences. For example, during a major flood event, a dam might activate its emergency spillway to prevent overtopping. While this action protects the dam, it can still result in downstream impacts. The non-failure mode in the diagram represents the risk associated with these non-failure scenarios. The diagram also includes two failure modes: Spillway erosion failure mode (PFM 1): This mode, shown in the center of the diagram, connects the hazard function at Dam A to the PFM 1 response function and consequence function. Concentrated leak erosion failure mode (PFM 2): This mode, shown at the bottom of the diagram, follows the same structure as PFM 1. Figure 10.9: RMC-TotalRisk risk diagram. The risk diagram connects input functions from left to right, linking them based on their hazard type (e.g., stage, flow) and units (e.g., ft, cfs). Circular or redundant connections are not allowed, making the risk diagram a type of directed acyclic graph (DAG). System components in the diagram are labeled by their selected hazard functions. You can rename system components by right-clicking their names in the diagram or editing their names in the Properties window. Failure modes within each component are labeled by their corresponding response functions. RMC-TotalRisk supports an unlimited number of failure modes per component, depending on the selected failure mode method. However, a single system is limited to 20 components due to virtual memory and runtime constraints. For example, you can evaluate the system risk for a watershed with up to 20 dams, each containing multiple failure modes. 10.7.1 Working with the Risk Diagram First, familiarize yourself with the diagram interface.

To disconnect two nodes, left-click and hold the input of the connected node, then drag the cursor to another node’s input or click any open space in the diagram. Node Types The diagram has four fundamental node types: Hazard Node: Describes exceedance probabilities for various hazard levels (e.g., peak flow-frequency or reservoir stage frequency). Hazard nodes define the system component’s identity and can have multiple outputs. Transform Node: Converts hazard levels from one type to another (e.g., flow to stage). Transform nodes can connect sequentially and have multiple outputs unless linked to a response function. For example, an unregulated flow-frequency function may need to be transformed into regulated flow and then transformed again from flow to stage to assess probability of failure on hydraulic structures downstream. Response Node: Represents the system’s conditional probability of failure at various hazard levels. Response nodes define failure modes and allow one output connection. Consequence Node: Defines the consequences of failure or non-failure. Non-failure consequences connect directly to the hazard node without a response function. Visual Feedback The diagram provides visual feedback for data validation: No Input Selected: Red outlines indicate a node with no input defined. Incomplete Connection: Black lines indicate valid connections that lack complete failure or non-failure modes. The risk calculations will not include this connection. Invalid Connection: Red lines indicate mismatched units or undefined inputs. Invalid connections prevent risk analysis. Valid Non-Failure Mode Connection: Purple lines indicate valid non-failure mode connections. A system component with complete non-failure mode connections is included in the risk calculations.

The hazard function is a river peak flow frequency curve, transformed into a peak river stage using a flow-to-stage rating curve from a hydraulic routing model. The diagram includes two failure modes: Prior OT (Backward Erosion Piping): Represents failure before overtopping. OT (Overtopping): Represents overtopping-related failure.

RMC-TotalRisk reports five types of risk, calculating each for a range of probable hazard events: Excess Risk: Represents the risk of system failure, calculated using the probability of the hazard, the probability of failure, and the excess consequences. Excess consequences refer to the additional losses or damages caused by failure, beyond those that would occur during the same event if the structure did not fail. Background Risk: Represents the risk assuming no structural flaws or vulnerabilities in the system. It reflects the risk from natural hazards alone, without accounting for the potential impacts of structural deficiencies. Total Risk: Represents the overall risk of the system (or component) and is calculated as the sum of failure risk and non-failure risk. Some USACE publications refer to total risk as residual risk (i.e., the risk that remains) [2] [9]. Proper estimation considers all potential hazard sources, their likelihoods of occurrence, and their potential consequences. Failure Risk: Represents the risk associated with system failure, calculated based on the probability of the hazard, the probability of failure, and the consequences of failure. Non-Failure Risk: Represents the risk associated with the system not failing, calculated using the probability of the hazard, the probability of non-failure, and the consequences of non-failure. Infrastructure such as dams and levees often incurs consequences even when it does not fail. For example, during a major flood event, a dam might activate its emergency spillway, preventing the dam from reducing downstream flooding. Dam and levee risk assessments often emphasize a limited range of flood and seismic hazard levels that could lead to failure, potentially overlooking the broader range of hazard levels that result in non-failure consequences. To accurately estimate background, non-failure, and total risk, it is essential to account for the full spectrum of hazard levels with adequate resolution. For a detailed explanation of the underlying mathematics for the five types of risk, refer to the technical reference manual [1]. The following subsections describe the contents and functionality of each of the three risk results tabs. References "],["loss-exceedance-plot.html", "11.1 Loss Exceedance Plot", " 11.1 Loss Exceedance Plot The Loss Exceedance Plot displays consequences on the x-axis and the exceedance probability on the y-axis. This type of plot is commonly referred to as an F-N curve, survival function, or Farmer’s diagram [10]. If the hazard function is defined with annual exceedance probabilities, the y-axis of the loss exceedance plot will also represent annual exceedance probabilities. A log-log scale is typically used due to the wide range of probabilities and consequences, often spanning multiple orders of magnitude. Figure 11.3 shows an example loss exceedance plot. After simulating risk with full uncertainty, the plot includes a 90% confidence interval shaded in red, along with the mean and median curves. By default, the USACE tolerable risk limit is displayed as a dotted black line [9]. You can customize this tolerable risk limit (TRL), also referred to as a guideline, or remove it from the plot as needed. Figure 11.3: Tolerable risk guideline viewing options for graphical risk results in RMC-TotalRisk. To customize the TRL, select an option from the Tolerable Risk Limits dropdown menu(Figure 11.4). Available options include None, USACE, ANCOLD (2022 guidance), or a custom limit. To automatically set the plot extents to match the selected TRL extents, check the Set TRL axis extents checkbox. Figure 11.4: Example of Loss Exceedance Plot results with confidence intervals and the USACE TRL. To add or edit custom limits, click the Edit/Add Tolerable Risk Limits button to open the Tolerable Risk Limit Editor (Figure 11.5). Figure 11.5: Tolerable Risk Limit Editor. References "],["conditional-loss-plot.html", "11.2 Conditional Loss Plot", " 11.2 Conditional Loss Plot USACE dam and levee safety programs commonly use the Conditional Loss Plot to display excess risk. In this plot, the conditional mean consequences are shown on the x-axis, and the probability of failure is shown on the y-axis. Similar to the Loss Exceedance Plot, a log-log scale is typically used due to the wide range of probabilities and consequences, which can span multiple orders of magnitude. Traditionally, USACE refers to this plot as the \\(f \\cdot \\overline{N}\\) plot (pronounced as “little f-N bar” to distinguish it from the “big F-N” plot). However, in probability and statistics, \\(f\\) typically represents the probability density function, not exceedance probability. To avoid confusion and align with conventions in other disciplines, RMC-TotalRisk does not use the \\(f \\cdot \\overline{N}\\) notation for this plot. Users can, however, customize the plot axis labels if desired. The Conditional Loss Plot is available only for failure risk and excess risk, as these risk types share the same probability of failure. Total risk and background risk are unconditional expectations where the total probability equals 1. Non-failure risk is a conditional expectation, where the total probability of non-failure equals 1 minus the probability of failure. However, since the probability of non-failure is typically very close to 1, this type of plot is not meaningful for non-failure risk. Figure 11.6 shows a Conditional Loss Plot after simulating risk with full uncertainty. Uncertainty is visualized as a scatter cloud, which is thinned to a maximum of 1,000 points per system risk component for clarity. A red diamond indicates the mean excess risk result for the overall system. In this example: The mean annual probability of failure is \\(8.7985\\times10^{-6}\\) The conditional mean excess consequence is \\(131.5435\\). Stated differently, the mean annual probability of failure is \\(8.7985\\times10^{-6}\\), and if the dam were to fail, the expected excess life loss would be \\(131.5435\\). The diagonal line on the plot represents the product of the probability of failure and the conditional mean loss, which equals the unconditional excess mean loss, \\(\\mathbb{E}[C]=1.1574\\times10^{-3}\\). This value plots slightly above the tolerable risk limit of \\(1\\times10^{-3}\\). Figure 11.6: Conditional Loss Plot displaying excess risk results as the probability of failure and the conditional mean life loss, showing USACE Tolerable Risk Limits as dotted black lines. "],["summary-statistics.html", "11.3 Summary Statistics", " 11.3 Summary Statistics The Summary Statistics tab displays result statistics for each of the filtered risk measures (Figure 11.7). Figure 11.7: Risk analysis results on the Summary Statistics tab in RMC-TotalRisk. Component: This column identifies the overall system by the name of the risk analysis. System components use the name of the selected hazard function by default, and failure modes are labeled with the system component name and the selected response function. Risk Type: This column lists the five types of risk that RMC-TotalRisk reports (excess, background, total, failure, and non-failure). Probability: This column shows the total probability for the risk type. For excess and failure risk, it represents the probability of failure. For background and total risk, the probability is always 1. For non-failure risk, it is 1 minus the failure probability, which is typically very close to 1. Conditional Mean Loss: This column displays the mean (or expected) consequences given system failure. The product of probability and conditional mean loss equals the unconditional mean loss, \\(\\mathbb{E}[C]\\). This measure is most relevant for excess and failure risk, where the probability of failure is explicitly considered. For background and total risk, the conditional mean equals the unconditional mean. Mean Loss, Ε[C]: This column shows the mean (or expected) consequences, calculated as a probability-weighted average over all hazardous events. In flood damage assessments, this value is commonly called Expected Annual Damage (EAD). In USACE dam and levee safety programs, it is referred to as Average Annual Life Loss (AALL). Standard Deviation, σ[C]: This column presents the standard deviation of the consequences, which measures deviation from the mean loss. When comparing two risk reduction alternatives with the same mean loss, the option with the smaller standard deviation is considered less risky. "],["risk-analysis-diagnostics.html", "12 Risk Analysis Diagnostics", " 12 Risk Analysis Diagnostics RMC-TotalRisk includes several diagnostic tools to help explore the Monte Carlo simulation results for a risk analysis with full uncertainty. These diagnostics are most useful when the risk analysis inputs include uncertainty. If no uncertainty is defined, the diagnostic tools have limited applicability. The following subsections describe the available risk analysis diagnostics. "],["integration.html", "12.1 Integration", " 12.1 Integration The integration diagnostics estimate the standard error of the computed total risk for the system and report the number of integrand function evaluations performed during the risk simulation. These diagnostics are displayed graphically as a kernel density or cumulative distribution plot. A table summarizes key statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, and key percentiles. Figure 12.1 shows an example of the integration diagnostics for the estimated integration standard error during the simulation. In this example, the integration standard error averaged \\(5.4×10^{-7}\\) for each Monte Carlo realization. Figure 12.1: Example of integration diagnostics. "],["risk-measures.html", "12.2 Risk Measures", " 12.2 Risk Measures RMC-TotalRisk computes seven risk measures for each of the five risk types: Probability: Represents the total probability of the risk type. For excess and failure risk, this is the probability of failure. For background and total risk, the probability is 1. For non-failure risk, it is 1 minus the failure probability, which is typically very close to 1. Conditional Mean Loss: Represents the mean (or expected) consequences given system failure. The product of probability and conditional mean loss equals the unconditional mean loss, \\(\\mathbb{E}[C]\\). This measure is most applicable for excess and failure risk, where the probability of failure is explicitly considered. For background and total risk, the conditional mean equals the unconditional mean. Mean Loss, Ε[C]: Represents the mean (or expected) consequences, calculated as a probability-weighted average over all hazardous events. In flood damage assessments, this term is commonly called Expected Annual Damage (EAD). In USACE dam and levee safety programs, it is referred to as Average Annual Life Loss (AALL). Standard Deviation, σ[C]: Represents the standard deviation of the consequences, which measures deviation from the mean loss. When comparing two risk reduction alternatives with the same mean loss, the option with the smaller standard deviation is considered less risky. Consequence Threshold Probability: Represents the probability of exceeding a user-specified consequence threshold. Value-at-Risk (VaR): Represents the minimum consequences for a user-specified exceedance probability \\(\\alpha\\). Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR): Represents the conditional mean (or expected) consequences for a user-specified exceedance probability \\(\\alpha\\). For mathematical details on these risk measures, refer to the technical reference manual[1]. As shown in Figure 12.2, you can select the desired risk type and risk measure from the dropdown menus to view the results. Figure 12.2: Select the risk type and risk measure to display results. You can display the distribution as either a kernel density plot or a cumulative distribution plot using the radio buttons at the bottom of the plot. Summary statistics for the distribution appear in the upper right-hand corner (Figure 12.3). Figure 12.3: Risk measure diagnostic tools in RMC-TotalRisk showing the kernel density of the excess mean loss, E[C]. References "],["risk-profile.html", "12.3 Risk Profile", " 12.3 Risk Profile A risk profile plots exceedance probabilities or conditional mean loss against increasing hazard levels. You can filter the risk profile results by system component and risk type. This plot helps identify critical hazard levels where the probability of failure or risk increases sharply. Figure 12.4 shows the hazard exceedance probability for the background risk at Dam A. Since background risk represents the residual risk from the natural hazard, this risk profile aligns with the input reservoir stage-frequency hazard function. Figure 12.4: Example of a risk profile plot showing the hazard exceedance probability for the background risk at Dam A. Figure 12.5 displays the hazard exceedance probability for the excess risk at Dam A. The profile shows an inflection point near a reservoir stage of 595 feet. This inflection occurs because Potential Failure Mode 1 (spillway erosion) has a nonzero probability of failure beginning at this hazard level. At this point, excess risk starts to increase. Figure 12.5: Example of a risk profile plot showing the hazard exceedance probability for the excess risk at Dam A. "],["assurance.html", "12.4 Assurance", " 12.4 Assurance RMC-TotalRisk provides an assurance plot and summary statistics based on a user-defined profile hazard type and hazard threshold. This diagnostic supports the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for levees. For more details, refer to the technical reference manual [1]. Figure 12.6 illustrates an example risk diagram for a levee risk analysis. The primary hazard is river peak flow frequency, which is transformed into a peak river stage using a flow-to-stage rating curve derived from a hydraulic routing model. Potential Failure Modes (PFMs) include a Prior OT failure mode from backward erosion piping and an OT failure mode. The top of the levee is at a river stage of 65 feet. Figure 12.6: Example risk diagram for a levee risk analysis. To compute assurance, select the profile hazard type and specify the hazard threshold for the desired system component in the risk analysis options, as shown in Figure 12.7. Profile Hazard: This option sets the hazard function used to construct risk profiles and estimate the probability of exceeding a hazard threshold. You can select the primary hazard function or any hazard-to-response transform functions. For levee accreditation analyses, use stage or water surface elevation as the profile hazard type. Hazard Threshold: This setting defines the hazard level for calculating the probability of exceeding that threshold. The default hazard threshold is 0. For levee accreditation analyses, use the top of levee height or elevation as the hazard threshold. The assurance diagnostic estimates the uncertainty in the annual probability of inundation (API). The level of assurance (e.g., 85% assurance for levee accreditation) corresponds to the confidence level of the API (e.g., the leveed area is inundated with a probability of 0.01 or less with 85% confidence). To assess assurance using RMC-TotalRisk, simulate the risk analysis with full uncertainty. Figure 12.7: Setting the profile hazard type and threshold level for the system component. After completing the risk analysis, navigate to the Diagnostics tab and select Assurance. The plot includes the following features: The API is plotted on the x-axis, while the non-exceedance probability of API uncertainty is on the y-axis. The mean API is represented by a vertical dashed blue line. If the assurance level is less than 65%, the target level line is a vertical red line. For assurance between 65% and 85%, the target level line is orange. Assurance levels above 85% are indicated by a green line. Figure 12.8 shows the standard cumulative distribution plot for assurance in the levee risk analysis example. The mean API is 0.00647, and the target level of 0.01 (100-year) has an assurance level of 84.6%, represented by the orange line. Since the assurance level falls between 65% and 85%, the levee accreditation recommendation must be supported by uncertainty analysis, past system performance, and other factors [11]. Figure 12.8: Example of the cumulative distribution plot for NFIP assurance. References "],["tornado-plot.html", "12.5 Tornado Plot", " 12.5 Tornado Plot A tornado plot (Figure 12.9) visually illustrates the sensitivity of risk results to input functions at each hazard level. The plot is based on the selected system component, risk type, sensitivity measure, and hazard level. Inputs are ranked from most sensitive at the top to least sensitive at the bottom. Sensitivity measure options include Sensitivity Index, Pearson’s Correlation, and Spearman’s Correlation. Risk sensitivity often varies with hazard level. For instance, at low hazard levels, the results might be most sensitive to uncertainty in the system response, while at higher hazard levels, they may become more sensitive to uncertainty in the hazard probability. You can adjust the hazard level by moving the slider next to the hazard level text box to explore how component sensitivity changes across the range of hazard levels. Figure 12.9: Example of a tornado plot for risk diagnostics. "],["x-y-plot.html", "12.6 X-Y Plot", " 12.6 X-Y Plot The X-Y plot evaluates the correlation between different system risk components and inputs. You can filter results by risk type, risk measure, X parameter, and Y parameter components. For example, you might set the overall risk of failure at the dam as the Y parameter and the risk of failure from an individual failure mode as the X parameter. In the dam risk example (Figure 12.10), the X-Y plot reveals a strong correlation between the excess risk of failure mode PFM 2 (concentrated leak erosion) and the excess risk of the overall system. This indicates that significant changes in the PFM 2 failure mode correspond to substantial changes in overall system risk. These findings are consistent with the sensitivity results shown in Figure 12.9. Figure 12.10: Example of a X-Y plot for risk diagnostics.
